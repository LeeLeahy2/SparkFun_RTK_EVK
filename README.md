Designed and manufactured in Boulder, Colorado, USA, the SparkFun RTK Evaluation Kit is the perfect development platform for your fixed or mobile high-precision positioning and navigation needs. In terms of connectivity, the SparkFun RTK EVK has the lot: WiFi / BT, Ethernet and cellular!

Under the hood, the RTK EVK is based on the Espressif ESP32-WROVER processor with 16MB flash and 8MB PSRAM. The GNSS is the excellent dual-band ZED-F9P from u-blox. The u-blox NEO-D9S provides L-Band reception and access to correction services such as PointPerfect. The u-blox LARA-R6001D provides worldwide cellular connectivity; insert your nano SIM into the front panel and away you go! A WIZnet W5500 provides 10 / 100 megabit Ethernet connectivity. Data storage is micro-SD. The OLED display is 128x64 pixels. The EVK supports multiple power options, including: USB-C; Power over Ethernet (PoE); and DC voltages in the range 9V - 36V.
